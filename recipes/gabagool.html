        <h2>Recipe Description</h2>

        <p>Every wondered what gabagool actually is? Me too, so I decided to make it and boy, did I bite off more than I could chew! The recipe goes in depth in covering everything from proper pepper pickling techniques, to picking the perfect
            produce. Not to mention picking the <em>proper pork</em> (it's not pancetta)! The proprietary sandwich-sauce is paramount as it packs flavor and propels the dish to new levels. People of all palette are left positively pleased!
        </p>

        <p>You should start off by pickling the banana peppers as this does take a bit of prep and only tastes better the longer you give it. While the peppers are pickling, go ahead and throw the sauce ingredients into a blender
            to get that going. Once everything has been sufficiently pulverized and the peppers are ready, it's time to start building that sandwich! Your hard-work is rewarded when you take that first bite of <strong>gabagool goodness</strong>! Enjoy.
